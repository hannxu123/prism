**PRISM: Probability Reconstruction via Shapley Measures**

Large language models (LLMs) can estimate probabilities of uncertain events, but direct prompting is often **noisy** and **opaque**. **PRISM** makes LLM-based probability estimation **calibrated** and **interpretable**: it quantifies each input factor’s marginal effect via Shapley-style paired contrasts and **reconstructs** the final probability from these factor-level contributions. Across finance, healthcare, and agriculture, PRISM reduces noise from raw prompting and reveals which factors drive the estimate—supporting trustworthy decision-making.
